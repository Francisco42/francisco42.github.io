                The objective of this exercise is to visualize and 
                compare the results of applying linear regression in two
                different ways, using the same data. All the necessary calculations
                were performed on a spreadsheet which can be found
                <a href="https://github.com/Francisco42/portafolio_IA1/tree/master/UT3%20-%20Algoritmos%20lineales">here.</a> 
                This example dataset
                is composed of just one input variable "x" and one output
                variable "y"
              </p>
              <p>
                x = {1, 3, 2, 4, 6, 5} <br />
                y = {1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 5}
              </p>
              <p>
                A dot graph of the data can be seen in Figure 1.
                The model will be a straight line defined by the equation:
              </p>
              <p>
                y = b0 + b1 * x
              </p>
              <p>
                Where b0 and b1 are the coefficients we need to estimate.
                The first method of calculating these coefficients will be
                by using the following formulas:
              </p>
              <p>
                b1 = &sum; (x<sub>i</sub> - mean(x)) * (y<sub>i</sub> - mean(y)) / &sum; (x<sub>i</sub> - mean(x))<sup>2</sup><br />
                b0 = mean(y) - b1 * mean(x)
              </p>
              <p>
                This gives us the following coefficients:
              </p>
              <p>
                b1 = 0.342857143<br />
                b0 = 1.466666667
              </p>
              <p>
                By using these in the previous equation, we can now
                plot the line that forms the model. This graph is shown in Figure 2.
                Finally, we can calculate the RMSE to get an estimate of the accuracy
                of this model:
              </p>
              <p>
                RMSE = 1.101225868
              </p>
              <p>
                The second method of calculating the coefficients involves applying
                gradient descent. Starting from b0 = 0.0 and b1 = 0.0, we can recalculate
                them at every epoch by performing:
              </p>
              <p>
                b0(next epoch) = b0 - learn rate * prediction error<br />
                b1(next epoch) = b1 - learn rate * prediction error
              </p>
              <p>
                Using a learn rate of 0.01, the final values of the
                coefficients after 24 epochs is: 
              </p>
              <p>
                b1 = 0.638197357<br />
                b0 = 0.217811901
              </p>
              <p>
                This gives us another model for our data. The resulting line graph
                can be seen in Figure 3. As we can see, this model is slightly different from
                the previous one. The RMSE for this model is:
              </p>
              <p>
                RMSE = 1.230204322
              </p>
              <p>
                The higher error indicates that the first model was a bit more accurate,
                even though both lines like a good approximation to the original dots.
                We can presume that this is possibly due to the limited number of epochs
                in the gradient descent. Ideally, we would want to continue the process
                until there is no significant reduction in the prediction errors.
              </p>

            Heart disease has a high prevalence. Approximately
            3-5% of hospital admissions are related to
            these incidents. The costs are very high, reaching up to 2%
            of total health costs in developed countries.
            Building an effective disease management strategy requires
            the analysis of a large amount of data, the early detection of
            disease, assessment of severity and early prediction of
            adverse events. This will inhibit the progression of the disease,
            improve the quality of life of patients and reduce the associated
            medical costs.
