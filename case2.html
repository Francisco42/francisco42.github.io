          <p>
            This exercise is based on one of the cases found 
            in the book "RapidMiner:
            Data Mining Use Cases and
            Business Analytics Applications". <sup><a href="#ref">[1]</a></sup>
          </p>
          <p>
            A fictional bank introduces a new financial product, 
            a type of account with certain fees
            and interest rates, different from other pre-existing products. 
            Some customers are drawn to this product and open accounts
            of that new type sometime after it's released, but others don't.
            The bank's marketing department wants to sell more of the new account
            through a direct mail campaign to customers who have not yet opted for it.
            However, such a marketing campaign requires time and resources, so as 
            not to waste efforts on customers who are unlikely to buy, they 
            would like to target only the 20% of customers who have the highest
            affinity for the product.
          </p>
          <p>
            To determine which are the customers who would potentially 
            want to buy the new
            product, we can assume that the customers who have already purchased 
            it (the buyers) are representative of those who have a great 
            affinity for it. So we can search
            for customers who have not yet purchased (non-buyers) but who are 
            similar to the
            buyers in other aspects. We expect that the more similar they are, 
            the greater their affinity will be.
            Therefore, identifying which of the customers' qualities
            are indicative of their similarity is going to be one 
            of the main challenges.
            Then, we can use a machine learning algorithm to generate a 
            ranking of non-buyers by their similarity to buyers, in which 
            those who have
            higher ranking will be customers predicted as potential new buyers.

          <h2 class="major">Business understanding</h2>
          <p>
              The main takeaways that will help us better understand the context
              of this project are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The bank offers 4 types of accounts: CH01, CH02, CH03
                and CH04. CH04 is the one that needs to be promoted.
            </li>
            <li>Each type of account has certain fees and monthly 
                interest rates involved, but some customers recieve
            special treatment due to their status or other particularities</li>
            <li>A customer can have any number accounts (even zero), 
                and any combination of types
            </li>
            <li>Accounts have opening and closing dates. A closed account
                has a balance of 0 and can no longer accept transactions.
                Opened accounts are considered "active", and a customer with at 
                least one active account is an active customer
            </li>
            <li>Every transaction is automatically classified based on
                a form that can be filled by the customer who initiates
                the transaction. Example of these categories include:
                cash withdrawals, salaries, and so on.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2 class="major">Data understanding</h2>
          <p>
            Now we need to see more carefully what the available
            data is made up of. The bank has chosen to store
            this data in a data warehouse with a star schema design, 
            where we have a fact table and 
            several dimension tables (Figure 1).

              <figcaption>Fig.1</figcaption>
            </span>
          <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Dim_Customers:</b> a row for each customer, includes 
                personal data such as first and last name, date of
                Birth (as a reference to the Dim_CalendarDates table), occupation, gender, 
                marital status, and income.
                The "income" attribute is set to zero for young clients, 
                but has many missing values
                for adults.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Dim_Accounts:</b> a row for each account, with a reference 
                to the account owner.
                Each account belongs to one of the four types CH01 through CH04 
                and has start and end dates (references the Dim_CalendarDates table).
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Dim_CalendarDates:</b> Contains a row for each of the 50,000 days 
                from January 1st, 1900 to November 22nd 2036. One row represents
                "infinity", which is used as the end date for accounts that do 
                not yet have one. The Date_ID attribute numbers the days conscutively. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Fact_Transactions:</b> Records all the transactions that have
                been made in each account. Each
                transaction includes a reference to the account owner and its 
                date.
                The credit/debit flag (values CR and DR) indicates whether the 
                money has been deposited or withdrawn from the account.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
              Compared to real data, this data has been simplified in a number of ways.
              One of these is that this star schema does not accomodate for
                slowly changing dimensions,
              which is a mechanism that enables a way of keeping a "history" 
              of values that change over time.
              Another simplification is that some customers are grouped together.
              A customer may represent a married couple, an entire household, or even a 
              corporate entity.
          </p>
          <h2 class="major">Data preparation</h2>
          <p>
            In order to build modelling algorithms from the data, we first
            need to have a single table of clean data that integrates
            all 4 of the tables mentioned previously. To do that we will build 
            3 subprocesses in RapidMiner. 
          </p>
          <h4 class="major">Customer data substream</h4>
          <span class="image fit">

            <figcaption>Fig.2</figcaption>
          </span>
          <p>
            The first of these substreams focuses on processing the customer
            table (Figure 2). The main operations performed are:
            <ul>
                <li></li>
                <li></li>
                <li></li>
                <li></li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h4 class="major">Account data substream</h4>
          <span class="image fit">
            <img src="images/affinity_sub2.PNG" alt=""/>
            <figcaption>Fig.3</figcaption>
          </span>
          <p>
            The second substream focuses on processing the account
            table (Figure 3). The main operations performed are:
            <ul>
                <li></li>
                <li></li>
                <li></li>
                <li></li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h4 class="major">Transaction data substream</h4>
          <span class="image fit">
            <img src="images/affinity_sub3.PNG" alt=""/>
            <figcaption>Fig.4</figcaption>
          </span>
          <p>
            The last substream focuses on processing the transaction
            table (Figure 4). The operations performed are:
            <ul>
                <li></li>
                <li></li>
                <li></li>
                <li></li>
            </ul>
